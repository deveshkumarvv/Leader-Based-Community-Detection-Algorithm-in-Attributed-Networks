## Introduction

This project, titled ”Leader-Based Community Detection Algorithm in Attributed Networks,” addresses the challenge of identifying central leaders and
organizing communities within complex networks enriched with attributes. The
relevance of this problem lies in its potential to revolutionize decision-making,
optimize resource allocation, and enhance collaboration efficiency across diverse
domains. Motivated by the need for nuanced insights into leadership dynamics,
our project proposes a novel algorithm integrating data analysis techniques and
advanced community detection methods. Persistent challenges include the intricate
interplay between attributes and network structures. Our work aims to
overcome these challenges, contributing to a deeper understanding of attributed
networks for informed decision-making and resource optimization.


## Features
